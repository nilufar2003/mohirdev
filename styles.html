            <p> Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.<br>
                Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,<br>
                <hr>
                when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.

                It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting,<br>
                remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, <br>
                and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
            <h2>Where does it come from?</h2>
            </p>
            <p style="color:crimson; text-align:center; font-weight:bold">Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source.
